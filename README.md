#LAXUS

>Around the dynamic-content billboard, a floor area is drawn to indicate an interactive area and recommends Bluetooth’s activation. When the user enters the range, the displays adapt. We can know the distance between the two devices and the language of the phone’s OS while receiving the signal. The closest user sees the display adapting to his preferences. Beyond the translation, the interactive work adjusts the typefaces according to the language, allowing to design the service according to the user. We also thought that the background could alter, and display some isometric design depending on the language found. For example, a french tourist will see an isometric Eiffel Tower on the background. Therefor, the user will be drawn to our display.
 We could extend our project to other public spaces. For example, ads could be translated near bus station as well as bus informations, in the same way that some companies have developed real-time text translation.
